I'm technical administrator of surveillance systems in the ANSP of the Czech Republic. Currently I work at the Department of Radar and Information systems. My daily job is to maintain and pamper our surveillance radars (PSR and Mode-S), multilaterations and A-SMGCS. My other activities include monitoring of 1030/1090 MHz frequency spectrum and transponder overinterrogation, surveillace data analyses and internal ATM research and development.

I come from academic environment (Czech Technical University in Prague), my doctoral dissertation was focused on passive sensing by a microwave radiometer. I have gained another academic experience during my long-term postdoc mission at Politecnico di Milano where I have developed a tool for data calibration within research project "Alphasat – Aldo Paraboni experiment: propagation data processing and analysis and models development". 

I play the upright-bass with my band and when an inspiration turns up I also write lyrics.
